# MusicZoneSystem

An adaptive music system by zone inspired by adaptive music systems like those in RDR2 or Zelda BOTW (My system isn't as complex as those titles).
Built using triggers, you can add as many zones as you want. It includes mute functionality and supports multiple tracks.
Values such as the main track volume, loop volume, fade-in time, and fade-out time are adjustable.
